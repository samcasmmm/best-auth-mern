 simple app for login and signup
 
Backend (Node.js with Express and MongoDB)
1. Setting up the Server
Initialize a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies (express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, mongoose, etc.).
Create a server using Express.js to handle HTTP requests.
Establish connection with MongoDB using Mongoose for data storage.
2. User Schema and Model
Define a User schema that includes fields like username, email, password, etc.
Use Mongoose to create a User model for interacting with the database.
3. Authentication Routes
Implement routes for user authentication: /signup and /login.
For signup, validate input data, hash the password using bcrypt, and save the user to the database.
For login, verify credentials, generate a JWT upon successful authentication, and send it back to the client.
4. JWT Generation and Validation
Create functions to generate and verify JWT tokens using jsonwebtoken.
Use a secret key to sign the JWT payload to ensure its authenticity.
